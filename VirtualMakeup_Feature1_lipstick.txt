## Lip stick ##

1. Identify coordinates

1.1 Show all landmark points

1.2 Identify Lip index points

1.3 Segment the lip in sub-parts

    Manually divide the lip in fewer points in order to keep the shape with hull.
    This is especially relevant when using a picture where one has the mouth more open

2. Find Lip ROI

3. Create lip mask

4. Cut out ROI + ROI mask

5. Define the colors

6. Change the color to the wanted one in the inverted mask

6.1 Dilate the inverted mask
    
    Using a small kernel

6.2 Change the color

    Use np.where to change to the wanted color.

6.3 Gaussian Blur

    Gaussian Blur the mask, using different kernel sizes for x and y

6.4 Perform mixed seamless cloning

7. Reinsert ROI
