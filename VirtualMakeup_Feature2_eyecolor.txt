3. Find the center of the eyes with houghcircles
   Inner circle of left eye is not findable with Houghcircles (Result None), probably due to the light which is reflected in the eye

3.1 Make the outer radius smaller in order not to change the color of the dermis

4. Create roi masks of the eyes and invert them

5. Define colors

5.1 Change Color in inverted mask as basis for seamless cloning

5.2 Blur the inverted mask

6. Perform seamless cloning
